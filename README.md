# Java Swing GUI Application

## Overview

This Java application demonstrates a basic use of Swing to create a graphical user interface. The program features a window (`JFrame`) divided into two colored panels (`JPanel`) with titles and two buttons for potential interaction.

## Features

- **Two Colored Panels**: The window is split into a red left panel and a blue right panel.
- **Panel Titles**: Each panel has a title label with contrasting text color.
- **Toggle Buttons**: Two buttons are included, potentially to toggle the visibility of the panels.
- **Resizable Layout**: The layout adjusts as the window size changes.

## How to Compile and Run

### Prerequisites

- Java Development Kit (JDK)
- A Java IDE (like IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, or NetBeans) or a simple text editor.

### Compilation and Execution

1. Copy the provided Java code into two files: `MyWindow.java` and `Main.java`.
2. Open your Java IDE or command line tool.
3. Navigate to the directory containing `MyWindow.java` and `Main.java`.
4. Compile the program:
   - In the IDE: Use the built-in compile and run tools.
   - In the command line: Run `javac MyWindow.java Main.java` to compile.
5. Run the compiled program:
   - In the IDE: Run the program using the IDE's run tool.
   - In the command line: Run `java Main`.

## Usage

- On running the program, a window will appear with two panels:
  - The left panel is red with a blue title.
  - The right panel is blue with a red title.
- The window also contains two buttons, which currently have no attached functionality.

## Contributing

This project is a basic template for a Swing GUI application. It can be extended in various ways, such as adding functionality to the buttons or introducing new components. Contributions are welcome:

1. Fork the repository.
2. Create a new branch for your feature (`git checkout -b feature/YourFeature`).
3. Commit your changes (`git commit -am 'Add some YourFeature'`).
4. Push to the branch (`git push origin feature/YourFeature`).
5. Open a pull request.
